# Minimalistic Embeded Test Engine

METEN - is a Minimalist Embedded Testing Engine. You can "embed" test into task source code and conditionally run them.

It's like task check but much simpler, and it's pure Raku rather than DSL:

    $ cat test.raku

    self.stdout-ok("'foo: {self.task-config<foo>}'");

More documentation comming soon.
