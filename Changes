0.0.6  2019-07-29T21:04:41-05:00

    - Documenting Task Runner
    - New feature - reference to task within root through `root@task` notation
    - Fixing powershell weird behavior. Sparrow6 hangs when try to read stderr.
      Workaround: Now stderr redirected to stdout and stderr never captured.
