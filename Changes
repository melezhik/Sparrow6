    - Refactoring: replace perl6 run by Proc::Async

0.0.8  2019-07-30T23:09:07-05:00

    - Revert powershell related changes made in 0.0.6 release,
      because it's not a blame of Sparrow6 that it hangs 
      when executing _some_ Powershell commands
      that block console stdout, for example Invoke-WebRequest
      use $global:progressPreference = 'silentlyContinue' as a workaround
      see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18770723/hide-progress-of-invoke-webrequest

    - Use modules for Powershell harness ( glue.psm1 and sparrowlib.psm1 ) rathe then scripts


0.0.7  2019-07-30T17:43:43Z

    - Bugfix: use module `glue` in Perl6 tasks

0.0.6  2019-07-29T21:04:41-05:00

    - Documenting Task Runner
    - New feature - reference to task within root through `root@task` notation
    - Fixing powershell weird behavior. Sparrow6 hangs when try to read stderr.
      Workaround: Now stderr redirected to stdout and stderr never captured.

    - Travis tests fixed
    - Documentation refinement
    - Args stringification implemented
    - Removed /home/melezhik/projects/sparrow6/examples/tasks/lib/, 
      because it's caused weird failures in my tests,
      I should raise this issue with Perl6 community
