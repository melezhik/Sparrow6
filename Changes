0.0.8  2019-07-30T23:09:07-05:00

    - Revert powershell related changes made in 0.0.6 release,
      because it's not a blame of Sparrow6 that it hangs
      when executing _some_ Powershell commands
      that block console stdout, for example Invoke-WebRequest
      use $global:progressPreference = 'silentlyContinue' as a workaround
      see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18770723/hide-progress-of-invoke-webrequest

    - Use modules for Powershell harness ( glue.psm1 and sparrowlib.psm1 ) rathe then scripts
