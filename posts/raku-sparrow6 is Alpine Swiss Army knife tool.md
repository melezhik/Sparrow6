Sparrow is a Rakulang based framework that allows operations to automate routine tasks, the beauty of it - one can use prepacked plugins available from public Sparrow repository - https://sparrowhub.io

## Install Sparrow framework

```bash
sudo apk add --no-cache --wait 120 -u --repository=http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community raku-sparrow6
```


Setup plugins repository 

```bash
export SP6_REPO=http://sparrowhub.io/repo
s6 --index-update
```


## Search alpine plugins

Sparrowhub has a lot of plugins, to limit search to Alpine related plugins:

```bash
s6 --search alpine
```

## Run plugin


To run plugin, use Sparrow cli, you can also pass parameters to a plugin. For example, to validate APKBUILD file one can use `apkbuild-strict` plugin:

```bash
s6 --plg-run apkbuild-strict@path=/path/to/apkbuild-file/
```

## Conclusion 

It'd be great to hear feedback from Alpine users, what sort of tasks could be implemented by Sparrow
